# Palmr Helm Chart

[![Artifact Hub](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/palmr-helm)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=palmr-helm)

This Helm chart is designed to deploy [Palmr](https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr/tree/main), an open-source file-sharing platform focused on privacy and security, on your Kubernetes cluster.

Palmr gives you the ability to host your own file transfer service without relying on third-party providers, ensuring full control over your data. For more details about Palmr, please visit the [official documentation](https://palmr-docs.kyantech.com.br/).

## Overview

This chart deploys the following components:

- **PostgreSQL:** Stores metadata and user data.
- **MinIO (Optional):** Provides S3-compatible object storage for file storage.  
  Alternatively, you can choose to use local persistent storage (e.g., backed by Longhorn) if you disable the MinIO deployment.
- **Palmr:** The main application server.

The configuration is adaptable, enabling you to choose the preferred storage backend by simply toggling values in the chart's `values.yaml`.

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster (v1.18 or later is recommended).
- Helm 3 or later installed.
- (Optional) A storage class such as Longhorn if you plan to use local persistent storage instead of MinIO.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Chart Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-helm-repo/palmr-helm-chart.git
   cd palmr-helm-chart
   ```

2. **Customize the Values**

   Edit the `values.yaml` file to configure PostgreSQL, MinIO (or local storage), and Palmr according to your needs.

3. **Install the Chart**

   ```bash
   helm install my-palmr ./palmr-helm-chart
   ```

   To override settings at install time, use the `--set` flag. For example, to disable MinIO and use local storage:

   ```bash
   helm install my-palmr ./palmr-helm-chart --set minio.enabled=false --set palmr.storage.useMinio=false
   ```

## Configuration

Refer to the `values.yaml` file for a complete list of configurable parameters:

- **PostgreSQL:**
    - `postgres.username`
    - `postgres.password`
    - `postgres.db`
    - `postgres.persistence.size`

- **MinIO:** (enable or disable MinIO deployment)
    - `minio.enabled`
    - `minio.rootUser`
    - `minio.rootPassword`
    - `minio.persistence.size`

- **Palmr:**
    - `palmr.image`
    - `palmr.replicaCount`
    - `palmr.storage.useMinio`  
      Set this to `true` to use MinIO or `false` to use local storage via a dedicated PVC.
    - `palmr.storage.pvc.size`
    - `palmr.storage.pvc.storageClassName`
